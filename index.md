**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was fairness metrics that are used to assess bias. I thought it was interesting to see the mathematical definition of each statistic and how its meaning can be interpreted to assess bias in a model's performance. It was also interesting to learn about how and when to apply which specific metric to get the most insightful results.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation I would like to pursue in the Quarter 2 project is algorithmic bias in people's social media feeds. Seeing whether or not there is bias in why people are recommended the content that they are is interesting. I would like to investigate whether there is a demographical basis or if it is purely based on interest and interaction, or a combination of both.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change I would make to the approach taken in our Quarter 1 project would be to experiment with better utilizing the bias and trends discovered in the EDA to improve model performance. I want to expand our use of insights on our data before feeding it to our model to further mitigate bias.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would be interested in using AIF360's built-in fairness metrics in the project to better understand bias in the data and model and see how to best mitigate it. I would like to explore bias mitigation techniques in the pre-processing, during, and post-processing stages to see which combination is most effective for the goal of debiasing, specifically in the context of social media.
